  hurt to keep the right semantic elements in there, too.
  IMPORTANT: each slide needs its own unique ID - this will become its

Noone controls the web. When someone (like Mozilla) has an idea, they implement it as a prototype and propose it for standardization
If the prototype becomes popular, the browser vendors and others collaborate on a standard that everyone can implement
webRTC is a complex beast that makes it possible for browsers to communicate directly. Google prototyped and proposed it. Others are now implementing it.
If someone doesn't like the proposal, like how Microsoft is afraid of webGL, they can either unwillingly implement it or have a browser that is worse than the rest.
This is innovation on the web. Everyone innovating and everyone collaborating. That is what the webAPIs are all about. Moving the web to mobile.

There is something called the Ubuntu Phone. A brand new phone that builds on ubuntu and competes with high end Andoird and iPhone. Sexy stuff, but iPhone sexy?
Mozilla realizes Apple has a few years on them, so initialy they target the two billion people that is using fragmented, broken andoirds, feature phones or no phone at all today.

Might be hard to imagine this web phone competing with native mobile apps, but think about the desktop.
Before I only read newspapers and checked the weather on the web.
Today I read all my email, write all my documents and even watch TV in the browser.
Today the browser is the best development environment on desktop for nearly every type of application and why should mobile be any different?

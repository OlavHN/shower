At one point Netscape gave in and Mozilla came out of the ashes as an open source initiative. They reverseengineered Microsofts extensions and managed to truly opened up the web.
Once the web was standardized and people started caring about making standards compliant websites the web flourished. Today you can use most of your services in the same way no matter what operating system you're using or no matter what browser, because the services are built with standard web technologies.

Today we see similar problems on mobile. Apps are built for closed ecosystems and a few companies have a lot of control in how these ecosystems evolve. Its true that smartphones have browsers, but the browsers are just minified desktop browsers. They can't utilize the phone the way native apps can.

in the near future we'll see things like webcomponents and proper mobile integration. Because noone fully controls the web everyone is innovating. Google is doing webcomponents, Mozilla is going mobile and Microsoft is doing DRM - all in parallell! The innovations that succeed,  are standardized and become first class citizens are the technologies that become popular, the technolgies that people use. Take webGL for example, Microsoft are big on gaming so they didn't really want enable great gaming experiences on the web, yet as webGL came to all the other browsers Microsoft was forced to start working on it themselves or risk having an inferior browser. It's a great way of managing an ecosystem in the open!

So back to Mozilla. Mozilla is a non-profit organization tasked with promoting openness, opportunity and innovation on the web. Since other mobile ecosystems doesn't allow for distributed, open innovation Mozilla is paving the way for the web on Mobile. They do this by making Firefox OS, a phone that boots right to the browser and is fully built with the web stack - HTML, CSS and javascript.

It looks like this: Talking to all the hardware in a smartphone is a kernel called Gonk. This kernel happens to be same as the one in Android, since that kernel already has massive support for smartphone hardware. Directly on top of Gonk is Gecko - the rendering engine of Firefox which enables applications to be written in HTML, CSS and javascript very close to the metal. Finally there is Gaia - A full set of applications you would expect from a smartphone built with the webstack.

      <footer class="notes">
That is Firefox OS. The final peice of the puzzle is the webAPIs. The web today isn't powerful enough to make a true smartphone - telephony, SMS, app management, etc arn't part of the web. Instead of hacking these things in, Mozilla is promoting a new set of APIs, nicknamed the webAPIs, to give the web access to the phone. Just like the popularity of webGL forced it into all browsers, the success of Firefox OS could lead to these webAPIs becoming part of other browsers aswell, and that is the true goal of Mozilla with Firefox OS.

      <footer class="notes">
While apple is making 500 EUR phones and Google is intensely competing in the high end market, Firefox OS has been designed from the bottom to work really well on cheap hardware. By targeting the users that doesn't have a smartphone today, but could afford a low end one Firefox OS has a market of two billion potential users. By going for these users first Firefox OS doesn't need to compete head to head with the iPhone and brand new Android devices on first release, which is good.
